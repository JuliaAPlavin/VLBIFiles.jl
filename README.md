# VLBIFiles.jl

`VLBIFiles.jl` reads and writes a range of data formats typically used in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).

See the [notebook](https://aplavin.github.io/VLBIFiles.jl/test/examples.html) for docs and usage examples.

> [!NOTE]
> This package was originally named `VLBIData.jl`. Then, in 2025, [VLBIData.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAPlavin/VLBIData.jl) was dedicated to the data model definition and visibility calculations, and file IO functions were moved to `VLBIFiles` (this package). For convenience in change tracking, `VLBIFiles` continues `VLBIData` versions.
